This work-space encapsulates two projects in one place for visibility. The first of which is a UI for a FL Dashboard task-aggregating tool and the second is a RESTful API which at this moment takes a URL and returns it's JSON response. 


The point of this dual-project is work-space is to run a custom watch script that will compile and transpile ES6 --> ES5 syntax outputting the results to different directories when the build is complete.
